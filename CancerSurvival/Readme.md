# BREAST CANCER SURVIVAL 

The Data set is describing about the state of breast cancer among womens in a country.
Now days, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed life-threatening cancer in women and the leading cause of cancer death among women.

### Problem Statement

 Breast cancer is not a rare cancer anymore. One can truly survive from this by knowing the facts which are important for surviving the breast cancer. The data can help in revealing the condition of  this cancer in the country.
 
 # EDA- Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA, is the process of organizing, plotting and summarizing the data to find trends, patterns, and outliers using statistical and visual methods. It takes input data from a tabular format and represents it in a graphical format which makes it more human interpretable. It is an important step in a Machine Learning/Data Science project which should be performed before creating a Machine Learning model or a statistical model. Exploratory Data Analysis helps us in making assumptions required for statistical hypothesis testing or for Machine Learning Model fitting.
Fitting the data into the model without doing EDA is like fitting the data into a black box and waiting for the result. Exploratory Data Analysis helps us in extracting critical information at early stage and reduces the chance of getting unexpected outcomes from the applied ML model.
